# 1051. Height Checker

## Description

```
Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.

Example 1:

Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.

Example 2:

Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5

Example 3:

Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
```

## Solution

```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number}
 */

var heightChecker = function(heights) {
    let j = 0;
    let res = 0;
    let map = new Array(101).fill(0);
    for(let h of heights) {
        map[h]++;
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < map.length; i++) {
        while (map[i]--) {
            if (heights[j++] != i)
                res++;
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```
