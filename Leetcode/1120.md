# 1120. Maximum Average Subtree

## Description

```
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)

Example 1:

Input: [5,6,1]
Output: 6.00000
Explanation: 
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.
```

## Solution

```JavaScript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumAverageSubtree = function(root) {
    const helper = (root) => {
        if (!root)
            return {sum: 0, count: 0, max: 0};
        let left = helper(root.left);
        let right = helper(root.right);
        let sum = left.sum + right.sum + root.val;
        let count = left.count + right.count + 1;
        let max = Math.max(left.max, right.max, sum / count);
        return {sum, count, max}
    }
    return helper(root).max;
};
```
