# 22. Generate Parentheses

## Description

```
Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.

Example 1:

Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).

Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 1 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).

Example 3:

Input: root = [9]
Output: 1

## Solution

```JavaScript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var pseudoPalindromicPaths  = function(root) {
    let res = 0; 
    const helper = (node, map) => {
        if (!node)
            return;
        map[node.val] = (map[node.val] || 0) + 1;
        if (!node.left && !node.right) {
            let oneLet = 0;
            for (let el in map) {
                if (map[el] % 2 != 0)
                    oneLet++;
            }
            if (oneLet < 2)
                res++;
        }
        helper(node.left, {...map});
        helper(node.right, {...map});
    }
    helper(root, {});
    return res;
};
