# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

## Description

```
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:
"tree"
Output:
"eert"
Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"
Output:
"cccaaa"
Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"
Output:
"bbAa"
Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

## Solution

```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */

var frequencySort = function(s) {
    let ascii = new Array(127).fill(0);
    let max = 0;
    let res = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let c = s[i].charCodeAt(0);
        ascii[c]++;
        max = Math.max(max, ascii[c])
    }
    let bucketRes = new Array(max + 1).fill('');
    for (let i = 0; i < 127; i++) {
        let n = ascii[i];
        while (ascii[i]) {
            bucketRes[max - n] = bucketRes[max - n] + String.fromCharCode(i);
            ascii[i]--;
        }
    }
    return bucketRes.join('');
};
```
