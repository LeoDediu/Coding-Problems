# 187. Repeated DNA Sequences

## Description

```
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
```

## Solution

```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[]}
 */

var findRepeatedDnaSequences = function(s) {
    let hash = {};
    let res = [];
    let i = 0;
    while ((i + 10) <= s.length) {
        let curr = s.slice(i, i + 10);
        hash[curr] = (hash[curr] || 0) + 1;
        if (hash[curr] == 2)
            res.push(curr);
        i++;
    }
    return res;
};
```
