# 22. Generate Parentheses

## Description

```
You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

Example 1:

Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

Example 2:

Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

## Solution

```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {number[]} time
 * @return {number}
 */
var numPairsDivisibleBy60 = function(time) {
    let map = new Map();
    let res = 0;
    for (let el of time) {
        let rem = el % 60;
        if (map.has(60 - rem))
            res += map.get(60 - rem);
        if (rem == 0)
            rem = 60;
        if(map.has(rem))
            map.set(rem, map.get(rem) + 1)
        else
            map.set(rem, 1);
    }
    return res;
};
```
